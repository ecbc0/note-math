(The magnifying glass icon in the upper left corner, or `s` key open, `esc` close) Use the search function to search for label.

(this operation should be automated by javascript, but I don't know how)
You can also use the #link("https://github.com/ecbc0/note-math")[typst file] and the preview function of #link("https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist")[tinymist] to view this document.
