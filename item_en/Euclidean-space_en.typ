#indent[
Assume $A$ is a bounded closed interval, and $#B$ is a net of $A$

Since $A$ is a closed set, the definition of $closed(B)$ is the same for the topologies of $ℝ$ and $A$

Since $A$ is bounded, we can define the non-empty infimum set $L = {inf(B) in ℝ : B in #B}$ and the supremum set $U = {sup(B) in ℝ : B in #B}$

According to the property of nets (or using the corresponding interval net $[inf(B), sup(B)]$), it can be proven that all numbers in $L$ are $<=$ all numbers in $U$

$L$ has an upper bound, $U$ has a lower bound, so we can take the infimum/supremum, and it satisfies $sup(L) <= inf(U)$

We prove that $l = sup(L) in ⋂_(B in #B) closed(B)$

Take $B_0 in #B$, prove that $l in closed(B)_0$

_Proof_
#indent[
    Define $S = { inf(B) : B in #B and B ⊂ B_0 }$

    $S != ∅$ because $B_0 in S$

    $inf(B) in closed(B) ⊂ closed(B)_0$

    $closed(B)_0$ is a closed set, so $l_0 = sup(S) in closed(B)_0$

    $S = { inf(B) : B in #B and B ⊂ B_0 } ⊂ { inf(B) : B in #B } = L$

    Therefore $l_0 = sup(S) <= sup(L) = l$

    That is $l_0 <= l$

    Next, prove $l <= l_0$

    For each $B_1 in #B$, _since $#B$ is a net_, there exists $B in #B$ such that $B ⊂ B_0 ∩ B_1$

    Thus $B ⊂ B_0$, so $inf(B) in S$ and $inf(B) <= sup(S)$

    And $B ⊂ B_1$, so $inf(B_1) <= inf(B)$

    By the arbitrariness of selecting $B_1 in #B$, we have that $inf(B)$ is an upper bound of $L = { inf(B) : B in #B }$, so $sup(L) <= inf(B)$

    Thus $sup(L) <= inf(B) <= sup(S)$, which means $l <= l_0$

    Therefore $l = l_0$

    Since $l_0 in closed(B)_0$, then $l in closed(B)_0$
]
Due to the arbitrary choice of $B_0 in #B$, we have $l in ⋂_(B in #B) closed(B)$

Therefore $⋂_(B in #B) closed(B) != ∅$
