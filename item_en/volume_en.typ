  Affine independence := $x_k$ cannot be expressed as $sum_(i = 0 .. N without k) t_i x_i$

  Affine independence corresponds to the linear independence of $x_i - x_0$ after selecting one point e.g. $x_0$ as the origin

  If it is affine independent, then the vertices correspond to $t_k = 1 and t_(1 ,…, N without k) = 0$

  An $n$-dimensional affine space has at most $n+1$ affine independent points

  For the coordinates of $n+1$ affine independent points of an $n$-dimensional affine space $V$, $t_0 ,…, t_n$ have a one-to-one correspondence with the affine points of $V$

#image("../image/shear-transformation.jpg", width: 30%)

(image from p.587 of @ref-3)

Shear transformation volume invariance is algebraically e.g. $(v_1 + v_2) ∧ v_2 ∧ ⋯ ∧ v_n = v_1 ∧ v_2 ∧ ⋯ ∧ v_n$ or $det mat(
  1, 1;
  , 1;
  ,, ⋱;
  ,,,, 1
) = 1$

Scaling of edges $ℕ,ℤ,ℚ,ℝ$. e.g. $forall a in ℝ, Vol(a v_1, v_2 ,…, v_n) = a Vol(v_1, v_2 ,…, v_n)$

The stretching and shearing of parallelepipeds corresponds to the decomposition of $GL(n,ℝ)$ into elementary linear transformations, which is also used in Gaussian elimination (although they can be used for $m × n$ matrices)

#tag("volume-determinant") The volume change of parallelepiped $v_1 ,…, v_n$ is $A ∈ GL(n,ℝ), Vol(A v_1 ,…, A_n v_n) = det A Vol(v_1 ,…, v_n)$

Choose a basis $e_1 ,…, e_n$ of $ℝ^n$, the volume of the parallelepiped generated by it is $1$, and the volume of other parallelepipeds $A e_1 ,…, A e_n$ is $det A$

This is the oriented volume. $v_1 ∧ v_2 ∧ ⋯ ∧ v_n = - v_2 ∧ v_1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ v_n$ The set of parallelepipeds remains the same, so the absolute volume remains the same, but the directions of $v_1,v_2 ,…, v_n$ and $v_2,v_1 ,…, v_n$ are opposite

Oriented volume = Unoriented volume + Direction factor

$v_1 ,…, v_n$ linearly dependent ==> in a lower-dimensional subspace ==> zero volume. At this time, $A in GL$ can be extended to $A in Lin$, and zero volume algebraically corresponds to $A ∉ GL <==> det(A) = 0$

For $ℝ^n$'s $k$-th order parallelepiped and simplex

Map the parallelepiped to $ℝ^n$'s $k$-th order alternating tensor $(ℝ^n)^(∧ k)$'s decomposable element $v_1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ v_k$

#tag("try-to-define-volume-of-low-dim") Actually, we don't need "volume invariance", we only need the volume to transform in a desirable way, that is, transform in terms of form. We don't need to define the volume of the k-th subspace of $ℝ^n$ using the $n$ form of $ℝ^n$, because as long as we consider the k-th subspaces as manifolds (for example, by choosing a k-th basis to establish a coordinate system), they have their own volumes. Metric volume form is a good method to define the volume using a special family of coordinate systems in all $k$ subspaces at one time, where the metric length of $e_1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ e_k$ is also $1$, thus coinciding with the volume of $e_1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ e_k$ being $1$. For non-positive definite metric volume forms, there are some k-th subspaces where the metric length of $e_1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ e_k$ is zero, not coinciding with the volume of $e_1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ e_k$ being $1$. Anyway, the following discussion may still be useful, so it is kept.

How to define low-dimensional volume? Consider two methods. Similar to linear form vs quadratic form. The first is like defining $vec(v_1,v_2)$ as $v_1 + v_2$ or $|v_1 + v_2|$, the second is similar to defining $(v_1^2 + v_2^2)^(1/2)$ or $|v_1^2 - v_2^2|^(1/2)$

#let base-alt = $e_(i_1) ∧ ⋯ ∧ e_(i_k)$
#let index-alt = $i_1 < ⋯ < i_k$
#let coefficent-alt = $det mat(
  v _1^(i_1) , ⋯ , v _k^(i_1) ;
  ⋮,,⋮;
  v _1^(i_k) , ⋯ , v _k^(i_k)
)$

1. A basis of $ℝ^n$ gives a basis of the alternating tensor space $#base-alt, #index-alt$ 
#indent[
  Use it to define volume: For each $k$, a special alternating $k$ multilinear function or $k$ form of $ℝ^n$ $Vol_(n,k)$, defined as $Vol_(n,k) (#base-alt) = 1$, forall $#index-alt$

  So for a general parallelepiped $v_1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ v_k = (v_1^(i_1) e_(i_1)) ∧ ⋯ ∧ (v_k^(i_k) e_(i_k)) = sum_(#index-alt) #coefficent-alt #base-alt$ the volume is 
  $
    Vol(v_1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ v_k) &:= sum_(#index-alt) #coefficent-alt \
    "or " &:= abs(sum_(#index-alt) #coefficent-alt)
  $
  The volume of a nonzero decomposable alternating tensor can be zero, $A = mat(1,0;-1,1) in GL(2,ℝ)$ such that $Vol(2,1)(A e_1) = 1 - 1 = 0$. The shear transformation of order $n$ does not hold for order $k$

  *Question* A special basis is selected, so what other bases have the same result? or what is the linear subgroup that keeps the volume unchanged? 
  
  $SL(n,ℝ)$ does not preserve $k < n$ dimensional volume. e.g. $mat(1/2;,2)$ or $mat(-1;,-1)$ does not preserve $1$ dimensional volume

  matrix $A$ that preserves all order volumes $A = mat( 
    a^1_1, ⋯, a^1_n;
    ⋮,,⋮;
    a^n_1, ⋯, a^n_n
  ) in GL(n,ℝ)$ satisfies, for $k = 1 ,…, n$ for $#index-alt$, $Vol_(n,k)(A e_(i_1) ∧ ⋯ ∧ A e_(i_k)) = 1$, or $sum_(j_1 < ⋯ < j_k) det mat(
    a^(j_1)_(i_1), ⋯, a^(j_i)_(i_k);
    ⋮,,⋮;
    a^(j_k)_(i_1), ⋯, a^(j_k)_(i_k)
  ) = 1$

  *Example* $Vol_(n,1)(A e_i) = a^1_i + ⋯ + a^n_i$ (sum of elements in the $i$ th column). The $n-1$ and $1$ cases are similar, i.e. $a^i_j$ corresponds to the remaining sub式 
  
  (The cofactor is used in the $1,n-1$ alternating tensor decomposition representation of $det$, which can be generalized to the $k,n-k$ alternating tensor decomposition representation or Laplace expansion of $det$)

  *Example* $Vol_(2,1)(A e_i) = a^1_i + a^2_i$
  
  matrix $A$ preserves all $ℝ^2$ volumes $A = mat(
    a^1_1, a^1_2;
    a^2_1, a^2_2
  )$ satisfies
  $
    a^1_1 a^2_2 - a^2_1 a^1_2 &= 1 \
    a^1_1 + a^2_1 &= 1 \
    a^1_2 + a^2_2 &= 1

    a^2_2 &= 1 + x \
    A &= mat(1-x,-x;x,1+x)
