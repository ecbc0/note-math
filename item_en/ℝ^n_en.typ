  one of motivation of complex-number or $z^2 = -1$ is the characteristic polynomial equation of #link(<harmonic-oscillator>)[] $ξ^2 + ω^2 = 0$

  Another motivation for complex numbers comes from the factorization of polynomials. A *real* polynomial factorization can be completely in the form of products of $(x - a)$ or $(x^2 + p x + q)^2$, and the latter can be factored in $ℂ$ into the form $(x - a) (x - a^*)$, specifically, $x^2 + 1 = (x - #i) (x + #i)$. So for convenience, one can choose to use complex numbers, and you can still choose to think of this as just an algebraic convenience, without needing the geometry of complex numbers

  But in the following split complex, $x^2 + 1$ still cannot be factored into first-order polynomials. Even $x^2 - 1$ has four roots, with two extra $1/2 (1 ± #i-split)$

  Addition is the same as $ℝ^2$. Multiplication uses $#i-split^2 = 1$ or $1/#i-split = #i-split$ and the distributive law
  $
    (x + y #i-split)(x' + y' #i-split) &= (x x' + y y') + (x y' + y x') #i-split

#tag("linear") $ℝ^n$ linear structure

  struct homomorphism := a mapping $f$ that preserves struct

  *Example* linear struct hom $f: ℝ^n -> ℝ^m$ 
  - $x ∈ ℝ^n$ map to $f(x) ∈ ℝ^m$
  - $+ : (ℝ^n)^2 -> ℝ^n$ map to $f(+) : (ℝ^m)^2 -> ℝ^m$
  so $f(x+x')$ map to $f(x) f(+) f(x')$ or abbreviated as $f(x) + f(x')$

  linear struct hom is also called linear mapping

  This homomorphism can also be considered similar to the distributive law of scalar multiplication. Vector addition followed by linear mapping is equivalent to linear mapping followed by vector addition.

  bijection to itself + $f,f^(-1)$ hom = isomorphism

#tag("imaginary-automorphism") The new imaginary unit construction method is not coordinate-free, so we need to consider the automorphism of imaginary units $f : Im(𝕂) -> Im(𝕂)$ with $f(x y) = f(x) f(y)$. Since it preserves multiplication, it automatically preserves distance

  - $SO(3)$ for $ℍ$
  - $G_2$ for $𝕆$. $dim G_2 = 14 < 21 = dim (SO(7))$

  $G_2$ as automorphism of $𝕆$ illustrates that, without additional structure, such as multiplication $x ⋅ y$ and $|x ⋅ y|^2 = |x|^2 |y|^2$, only a simple linear space structure, it is impossible to give special groups like $G_2$.

  Trying to define linear algebra for $ℍ^n$. We immediately run into a problem: since $ℍ$ is non-commutative, scalar multiplication cannot be swapped with matrix multiplication on the same side at will. How should the scalar multiplication of the linear structure be defined? Should scalar multiplication on both sides belong to a single linear structure? One definition of a linear map is as a homomorphism between linear spaces. If we want to include scalar multiplication from both sides into the linear structure, then linear maps need to preserve multiplication on both sides. In the case of $ℍ^1$, it's already clear that this would make the range of linear maps too narrow. Therefore, the "linear structure" of $ℍ^n$ is defined as, for example, left-side matrix multiplication acting as the linear map, while right-side scalar multiplication ensures the linear map is a homomorphism of the linear structure.
