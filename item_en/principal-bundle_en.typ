Although integration on manifolds considers not being limited to a specific metric, differential manifolds have still not been singled out. 

The situation with fiber bundles is similar; the codomain and its symmetries seem uncertain in the general case.

*Example*

homogeneous space

frame bundle

principal-bundle-connection

invariant Î´ isotropy-group & orbit decomposition at every point

This intuition is inspired by the specific symmetry space with the triple $G,H,G/H$ as a fiber bundle
