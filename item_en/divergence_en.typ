$ℝ ∖ 0 = ℝ_(< 0) ⊔ ℝ_(> 0)$

$GL(n,ℝ) = det^(-1)(ℝ_(< 0)) ⊔ det^(-1)(ℝ_(> 0))$

There are two directions. for vector base of $ℝ^n$, change order once $e_i <-> e_j$ change orientable, introduce a $-1$ factor. This is somewhat similar to alternating-tensor. orientation defined as quotient of vector base with same orientation. equivalent to decompose of $GL(n,ℝ)$ $det^(-1)(ℝ_(< 0)) ⊔ det^(-1)(ℝ_(> 0))$

  simplx oriented boundary. The direction of the boundary ${x_0 ,…, x_n}$ of simplex ${x_0 ,…, x_n without x_i}$ is to define the direction for the $n-1$ affine subspace where the boundary is located, such that the interior $A$ is in the $n$-dimensional positive direction and the exterior $A^∁$ is in the $n$-dimensional negative direction 

  If we continue to define the direction for the boundary of the boundary, we will find that adjacent directions cancel out

  simplex vertices can construct a directed basis of $ℝ^n$ according to $x_0 -> x_1 -> ⋯ -> x_n$. Permutations make the directions differ by $sign(μ)$

  After selecting $x_0 ,…, x_n$ to be the positive direction of $ℝ^n$, the direction of the boundary is $(-1)^(i-1) x_0 ,…, x_n without x_i$

  similar to box

  *Example* Tetrahedron, right-hand rule, with the thumb pointing towards the inside of the tetrahedron to get the boundary direction (the index of the vertices in the picture starts from $1$ instead of $0$)

#tag("orientable-low-dim-polyhera") Polyhedron #link(<orientation-of-boundary-of-simplex>)[Orientable] is defined as: when constructing a polyhedron with simplexes, it is possible to define compatible orientations for all $k$ simplexes, such that the adjacent two $k$ simplexes $A, B$ have compatible orientations on their $k-1$ intersecting boundary simplexes, i.e., the orientation $O$ corresponds to the interior of simplex $A$ and the exterior of simplex $B$. The orientation $-O$ corresponds to the interior of simplex $B$ and the exterior of simplex $A$. i.e., simplex partition has well-defined interior and exterior.

No matter how the direction of each $k$ simplex is defined, there exists a pair of adjacent $k$ simplex $A,B$ whose $k-1$ connected boundary simplex directions are incompatible. i.e. Simplex partitioning has no well-defined inside and outside

Starting from the initial $k$ simplex, continuously and transitively defining compatible directions for adjacent $k$ simplexes, going around in a circle will lead to incompatible directions of the connected boundary simplex. Direction $O$ corresponds to the inside of $A,B$, direction $-O$ corresponds to the outside of $A,B$

  Similar to the one-dimensional #link(<fundamental-theorem-of-calculus>)[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]. Intuitively, divergence and the divergence theorem = high-dimensional Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

  Define #tag("exterior-differential") $#d ω (x) = lim_(σ -> x) frac(integral_(∂ σ) ω,Vol(σ)) Vol$ in coordinates, where $Vol$ is the volume of the coordinates, $σ$ is a large class of regions, and the calculation result does not depend on the choice of coordinates.

  Calculate $#d ω (x) = lim_(σ -> x) frac(integral_(∂ σ) ω,Vol(σ)) Vol$ using a box in coordinates. When all coordinates approach $0$, it will be a partial derivative $∂_i$ of something calculated for each coordinate axis direction. The result is $#d ω = #d (ω_(i_1 ⋯ i_k) #d x^(i_1) ∧ ⋯ ∧ #d x^(i_k)) = ∂_(i) ω_(i_1 ⋯ i_k) #d x^i ∧ #d x^(i_1) ∧ ⋯ ∧ #d x^(i_k)$, further simplification is omitted for now.

  *Question* What is the form of the exterior derivative calculation result in the barycentric coordinates of a simplex?
]
However, in the proof of the one-dimensional Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the division of a one-dimensional interval, the boundary of a one-dimensional interval, and the integral of the boundary of a one-dimensional interval are all too simple. High-dimensional regions are not that simple.

#tag("Stokes-theorem-simple") For higher dimensions, it is difficult if it is curved. First, deal with straight things i.e. simplex or parallelepiped. The division is also the same type of region, and the boundary cancellation is also simple. Then, similar to one dimension, approximate with the Mean Value Theorem of Differential + compact control. This proves Stokes' theorem for $ℝ^n$ simplex or parallelepiped.

#tag("Stokes-theorem-proof") *Question*
#indent[
  I changed my mind. According to the intuitive treatment of integrals on manifolds and Stokes' theorem, one should use direct subdivision of the manifold, rather than approximate subdivision.

  The subdivision in integration can be directly done using zero-order measurable sets (closed under diffeomorphisms). The regions used for subdivision in Stokes' theorem should be similar to finite perimeter sets in geometric measure theory or Whitney's geometric integration theory, hoping that they are closed under finite unions, intersections, and set differences, and closed under diffeomorphisms.

  The intuition is based on that in all measurable sets, some of them have finite integrable boundaries. Intuitively, the constraints should be similar to, in the polyhedral net approximating the measurable set, there exists a subnet that uniformly controls integrals of all projective or normalized compact support form (or other more general thing) on the boundary of the approximating polyhedron.

  Prove that a manifold with boundary is locally such a region, and the integral on the boundary of such a theory should coincide with the integral on the boundary in manifold theory.

  The proof of Stokes' theorem is: for a finite cover of compact support forms, subtract the overlaps, subdivide, then use Stokes' theorem for the subdivided regions, where integrals on internal boundaries cancel out, leaving only the boundary of the true manifold.

  Because the topology of a manifold may have nontrivial cohomology, for some cohomologically nonzero forms $ω$, its exterior differential form $#d ω$ cannot cancel out all internal boundaries when integral, and hence it will have some extra thing similar to "residue" in complex analysis. For example, (#tag("cohomology-hole"). *Example* In $ℝ^2 ∖ 0$, $#d 1/r$ or $(-x_2)/(|x|^2) #d x_1 + (x_1)/(|x|^2) #d x^2$, satisfying $#d^2 1/r = 0$, so have integral zero on $𝔹 ∖ 0$, but the integral of $#d 1/r$ over $𝕊^1$ as the boundary of $𝔹 ∖ 0$ is nonzero. *Example* $𝕊^1$ is homology isomorphism to $ℝ^2 ∖ 0$.

  Another example where the boundary integral cannot cancel out: if a vector field or form for which Stokes' theorem holds on a closed ball $𝔹$ has a closed disk-like region on its boundary removed, Stokes' theorem no longer holds. Intuitively, after removing a closed disk, the flux leaks out, indicating that the new boundary does not enclose the interior of the manifold. If an open disk were removed instead of a closed disk, the result would not be a manifold with boundary, it would have a boundary of codimension > 1, and the boundary of the boundary would not be zero.

  May need some kind of compact constraint, since non-compact will have some kind of infinity that makes boundary cancellation fail, and may have residue term
]
Things like the Gauss--Bonnet theorem of Euclidean metric manifold should also be provable using this method. Although it still needs to be considered why the result is a homology invariant Euler characteristic (off by an $n$-dimensional Euclidean volume factor, expressed as a power of $π$) that is independent of the metric.

*Todo* Given counterexamples like the Cantor set construction, almost everywhere analytic is not the correct approach to handle singularity. Instead, try to use deletion of singularity to get manifold with boundary.

I have not deal with the Stokes theorem for manifold without boundary, have not define $∂ M := ∅ and integral_(∂ M) ω := integral_(∅) ω = 0$. *Example* of manifold without $ℝ^n$
