In finite dimensions, a space of symmetric bilinear forms $S(n_+,n_-)$ with a non-degenerate signature is a submanifold of a space $S$ of symmetric bilinear forms, and its tangent space can be embedded into $S$, with $Δ g$ as the notation for the tangent vector at $g$

In manifold $M$, a space of symmetric bilinear forms $S(n_+,n_-)$ with a non-degenerate signature metric is a submanifold of a space $S$ of field of symmetric bilinear forms, and its tangent space can be embedded into $S$, with $Δ g$ as the notation for the tangent vector at $g$

#tag("Einstein_Lagrangian") := $("scal" - 2 Λ) #d Vol$. In coordinates $#d Vol = |g| #d x$

*Question* Is there a good explanation for using scalar curvature in the action?

The action contains second derivatives of $g$, so it cannot be treated with general first-order differential action theory.

Scalar curvature is not homology-scalar-curvature; the integral of the latter (proportional to $χ(M)$?) is homology invariant, so it always varies to zero, and has trivial eq.

*Prop* Variation with respect to $g$: $Δ "scal" ∼ - "Ric" + "divergence term", Δ|g| ∼ 1/2 |g| g$

So the product rule gives 

*Prop* In Einstein-Lagrangian, $Δ ("scal" |g|) ∼ |g| ("Ric" - 1/2 "scal" g) + "divergence term"$

_Proof_
#indent[  
  *Prop* The derivative of $det$ is $∂ det(A) = det A tr(A^(-1) ∂ A) = det A tr(∂ log A)$

  _Proof_ 
  #indent[
    $det(X) = det(A) det(A^(-1) X)$ and $∂ det(𝟙) = tr$. So
    
    $
      &∂ det(A^(-1) X)(A : "base", Δ X : "vector") \
      =& ∂ det (𝟙 : "base", ∂(A^(-1) X) (A : "base", Δ X : "vector") : "vector") \
      =& tr(A^(-1) Δ X)
    $
  ]
  So the variation of the volume form is
  $
    Δ|g| &= Δ|det g|^(1/2) \
    &= 1 / 2|det g|^(1/2) tr(g^(-1) Δ g)
  $
  Treating $"Ric"$ as a matrix, the adjoint $(g ⋅)^†$ can be written as
  $
    "scal" &= (g ⋅)^† "Ric" \
    &= tr(g^(-1) "Ric") 
  $
  *Prop* The differential of $A ⇝ A^(-1)$ is $- A^(-1) (∂ A) A^(-1)$. _Proof_ Using $0 = ∂ 𝟙 = ∂ (A A^(-1)) = ∂ A ⋅ A^(-1) + A ⋅ ∂(A^(-1))$

  So the variation of scalar-curvature is
  $
    Δ"scal" = tr(- g^(-1) (Δ g) g^(-1) "Ric") + tr(g^(-1) Δ "Ric")
  $
  Perform tedious calculations on the following

  - $Δ "Ric" = Δ ((g #cvt-prod)^† R)$
  - $Δ R$
  - $Δ Γ$

  This might be useful for calculations $∇ (g #cvt-prod)^† = (g #cvt-prod)^† ∇$ and $∇ (g ⋅)^† = (g ⋅)^† ∇$
  $
    tr (g^(-1) Δ "Ric") = ∇^† ∇ tr (g^(-1) Δ g) + ∇_⊙^† ∇_⊙^† Δ g
  $
  is a divergence (cf. #link(<Laplacian_of_tensor_field.typ>)[] for $∇^†,∇_(⊙),∇_(⊙)^†$)

  - $tr(g^(-1) Δ g) = g(Δ g, g)$
  - $tr(- g^(-1) (Δ g) g^(-1) "Ric") = g(Δ g, - "Ric")$
  
  ==>

  - $Δ|g| = 1 / 2 |g| g(Δ g, g)$
  - $Δ "scal" = g(Δ g, - "Ric") + "divergence term"$

  Let the variation of the action be zero
  $
    0 = - integral #d x 
    |g| g (Δ g , "Ric" - (1/2 ⋅ "scal" - Λ) ⋅ g)
  $
]
forall $Δ g$, therefore

#tag("Einstein_equation") #tag("Einstein_metric")

$ "Ric" - (1 / 2 ⋅ "scal" - Λ) ⋅ g = 0 $

is equivalent to (by taking $(g ⋅)^†$)
$
  "Ric" &= (2 Λ) / (n-2) ⋅ g \
  &= 1 / n ⋅ "scal" ⋅ g
$
with $Λ = (1/2 - 1/n) "scal"$

i.e. $"Ric"$ is constant proportionally to $g$ and scalar-curvature is constant

equivalently
$
  "tr-free-Ric" &= 0 \
  "scal" &= (2Λ) / (n - 2)
$
i.e. trace-free Ricci-curvature is zero, and scalar-curvature is constant

Einstein-equation is a second-order nonlinear PDE for $g$

when $n = 4$, $"Ric" = Λ ⋅ g$ with $Λ = 1/4 "scal"$

When there is interaction, although $T = "Ric" - (1/2 ⋅ "scal" - Λ) ⋅ g != 0$, the divergence is still zero $∇_⊙^† T = 0$

_Proof_
#indent[
  $g$ does not need to be Einstein-metric

  δ diffeomorphism $X$ generates a first-order infinitesimal of the metric $Δ g = ∇_⊙ X$ 
  
  Because Einstein action is diffeomorphism invariant, the result of the δ diffeomorphism $X$ variation is zero
$
  0 &= integral g(Δ g, T) #d Vol(g) \
  &= integral g(∇_⊙ X, T) #d Vol(g) \
  &= integral g(X, ∇_⊙^† T) #d Vol(g)
$
forall $X$, therefore $∇_⊙^† T = 0$
$
  ∇_⊙^† ("Ric" - (1 / 2 ⋅ "scal" - Λ) ⋅ g) = 0
$
This will give $ ∇_⊙^† "Ric" = ∇_⊙ "scal" $

*Prop* For Einstein action, the energy-momentum tensor of δ-isometry will be zero

moduli-space-of-Einstein-metric := the orbit space of the metric space acted upon by diffeomorphisms, restricted to the Einstein-metric space. isotropy-group is isometry

*Question* Even if we know all Einstein-metrics for every manifold, we still don't know which manifold to choose

*Question* The classification of manifolds with constant-sectional-curvature or simple-symmetric-space seems satisfactory

When dimension $>= 4$ there exist manifolds that do not allow constant-sectional-curvature metric but allow Einstein-metric
