Consider the subspace $span(v,w) ↪ ℝ^(p,q)$

The following are equivalent
- $dim(span(v,w)) = 2$
- $v,w$ not co-linear

if $span(v,w) ≃ ℝ^(1,1)$, according to the intuition of $ℝ^(1,1)$ (draw a picture), bases of the following types are all possible
- 2 time(-like)
- 2 space
- 1 time, 1 space
- 1 time, 1 light
- 1 space, 1 light
- 2 light

*Example*

- 2 time(-like) \
  #indent()[
    $v = vec(1,0), w = vec(a,b)$, where $0 < |b| < |a|$ \
    $⟨ w ⟩^2 = a^2 - b^2 > 0$ \
    $v, w$ can linearly generate $vec(0,1)$, thus spanning $ℝ^(1,1)$
  ]
- 2 space \
  $v = vec(0,1), w = vec(a,b)$, where $0 < |a| < |b|$
- 1 time, 1 space \
  $v = vec(1,0), w = vec(0,1)$
- 1 time, 1 light \
  $v = vec(1,0), w = vec(a,a)$
- 1 space, 1 light similarly
- 2 light \
  *Example* $ℝ^(1,1), v = vec(a,a), w = vec(a,-a)$. Note $v ⋅ w = 2 a^2 != 0$. \
  $v ± w$ generate $ℝ^(1,1)$

Consider a general $span(v,w)$ in $ℝ^(1,n)$

#tag("signature-of-2d-subspace-of-spacetime") *Prop* The possible signatures of a $dim = 2$ $span(v,w)$ in Minkowski $(1,n)$ are

- $1,1$
- $0,2$
- $0,1$

We will prove later that signatures $(1,0), (0,0)$ are impossible

Intuitively, the plane spanned by two lines (imagine the case of $ℝ^(1,2)$)
- $1,1$ intersects both the interior and exterior of the light cone. Although all types of bases are possible, all bases of the following types are of signature $1,1$
  - 2 time
  - 1 time, 1 light
  - 2 light
- $0,2$ only intersects the exterior of the light cone
  - 2 space
- $0,1$ is tangent to the light cone, does not intersect the interior of the light cone, and intersects the light cone only along a single light-like line
  - 1 light, 1 space

*Prop* $ℝ^(1,n)$ can have $0,1$ signature subspaces. _Proof_ $ℝ^(1,2)$'s $vec(1,1,0),vec(1,1,1)$

*Prop* time-like is orthogonal only to space-like

let $v$ be time-like. Using orthogonal decomposition $ℝ^(1,n) = v ⊕ v^⟂$, let $v = v_0, w = w_0 + bf(w)$ then $⟨ v,w ⟩ = v_0 w_0 = 0 ==> w_0 = 0$ ==> $w$ is space-like

*Prop* light-like $v$ is not orthogonal to
- time-like. because time-like is orthogonal only to space-like
- light-like vectors other than those colinear with itself $k v$ #tag("metric-cannot-distinguish-colinear-light-like")

_Proof_
#indent[
  Take an orthogonal decomposition $ℝ^(1,n) = ℝ_"time" ⊕ ℝ^n_"space"$, let $v,w$ be light-like and orthogonal
  $
    v &= v_0 + bf(v) \
    w &= w_0 + bf(w)
  $
  $
    dmat(delim: #none ,
      ⟨ v ⟩^2,=,0,==>,v_0^2,=,⟨ bf(v) ⟩^2 ;
    ⟨ w ⟩^2,=,0,==>,w_0^2,=,⟨ bf(w) ⟩^2 ;
    ⟨ v,w ⟩,=,0,==>,v_0 w_0,=,⟨ bf(v) , bf(w) ⟩
    )
  $
  $bf(v), bf(w)$ are space-like. According to the Euclidean inner product inequality
  $
    ⟨ bf(v), bf(w) ⟩^2 &<= ⟨ bf(v) ⟩^2 ⟨ bf(w) ⟩^2 \
    (v_0 w_0)^2 &<= v_0^2 w_0^2
  $
  but $(v_0 w_0)^2 = v_0^2 w_0^2$, so the Euclidean inner product inequality takes equality, thus $bf(v), bf(w)$ are colinear $bf(w) = k bf(v)$.
  $
    v_0 w_0 &= ⟨ bf(v) , bf(w) ⟩ \
    &= k ⟨ v ⟩^2 \
    &= k v_0^2
  $
  This implies $w_0 = k v_0$, thus $w = k v$

*Prop* The signature of a two-dimensional subspace of $ℝ^(1,n)$ cannot be $1,0$ or $0,0$

_Proof_ Use the previous theorem

  *Question* Is there a proof that does not rely on orthogonal decomposition of time and space? But note, this proposition does not hold for general $ℝ^(p,q)$. In $ℝ^(2,2)$, the following are orthogonal and non-collinear
  - 1 time, 1 light $v = vec(1, 0, 0, 0), w = vec(0, 1, 0, 1)$
  - 2 light $v = vec(1, 0, 1, 0), w = vec(0, 1, 0, 1)$
  A further concept is "Totally Isotropic Subspace"

*Prop* When $p,q >= 2$, all signatures are possible for the subspace $span(v,w)$ of $ℝ^(p,q)$

_Proof_ In this case $ℝ^(p,q)$ contains the subspace $ℝ^(2,2)$, where it is easy to construct subspaces of all possible signatures

*Prop* For two non-collinear time-like vectors $v,w$ in $ℝ^(1,n)$, the signature of their span $span(v,w)$ is $1,1$

_Proof_ Use one of the time-like vectors as the initial basis to generate an orthogonal basis for $span(v,w)$, but the signature cannot be $1,0$, so it must be $1,1$

*Prop* In $ℝ^(1,n)$ let $v$ be light-like, $w$ be time-like or light-like, and $v,w$ be non-collinear. Then $span(v,w) ≃ ℝ^(1,1)$

_Proof_
#indent[
  $⟨ v ⟩^2 = 0$

  $v,w$ are not orthogonal, $⟨ v,w ⟩ != 0$
  $
    ⟨ a v + b w ⟩^2
    &= 2 a b ⋅ ⟨ v,w ⟩ + b^2 ⋅ ⟨ w ⟩^2 \
    &= b ( b ⋅ ⟨ w ⟩^2 + a ⋅ ⟨ v,w ⟩)
  $
  Fix a $b > 0$, consider
  $
    b ⋅ ⟨ w ⟩^2 + a ⋅ ⟨ v,w ⟩ = ⟨ v,w ⟩ (a - (-b ⋅ ⟨ w ⟩^2)/⟨ v,w ⟩)
  $
  By adjusting $a$, positive or negative results can be obtained, thus having time-like and space-like, so the $±$ signatures are both $>= 1$, it can only be $1,1$

  Another method. The quadratic form corresponds to matrix $G = mat(⟨ v,v ⟩, ⟨ v,w ⟩; ⟨ w,v ⟩, ⟨ w,w ⟩)$ in basis $v,w$. Transforming to signature standard form corresponds to matrix transformation $A^⊺ G A = mat(λ_1;,λ_2)$
  $
    λ_1 λ_2 = det mat(λ_1;,λ_2) = (det A)^2 det G = - ⟨ v,w ⟩ ^2 (det A)^2 < 0
  $
  Thus $λ_1, λ_2$ are one positive and one negative, corresponding to $1,1$ signature

  According to orthogonal basis extension, it can be proved

  in $1,n$, the orthogonal complement of a $dim = n$ space-like subspace is a $dim = 1$ time-like subspace

  - ($span(v,v') ≃ ℝ^2$ space-like) <==> (there exists a time-like $w$ orthogonal to both $v,v'$) \
    _Proof_
      Note, time-like is only orthogonal to space-like
      - (==>) Start extension from $span(v,v')$. The time-like $w$ basis vector is orthogonal to the space-like basis vectors
      - (<==) Start extension from $w$. All space-like basis vectors form the orthogonal complement space $w^⟂$ of $w$. $v,v'$ are orthogonal to $w$, so belong to $w^⟂$, and all subspaces of Euclidean space are Euclidean

  Thus the contrapositive also holds

  - ($span(v,v') cancel(≃) ℝ^(2)$ not space-like) <==> (there does not exist a time-like $w$ orthogonal to both space-like $v,v'$)

  Intuition: Different space-like subspaces $S,S'$ may not have compatible time measurement methods or the time-like orthogonal complements of $S,S'$ may be different

Take a spacetime orthogonal decomposition of $ℝ^(1,n)$

$v = v_0 + bf(v)$

$⟨ v,w ⟩ = v_0 w_0 - ⟨ bf(v) , bf(w) ⟩$

*Prop* $⟨ v ⟩^2,⟨ w ⟩^2 >= 0$ ==> The sign of the product of time components determines the sign of the inner product
$
  sign(v_0 w_0)
  &= sign(v_0 w_0 - ⟨ bf(v) , bf(w) ⟩) \
  &= sign(⟨ v,w ⟩)
$
_Proof_ Case analysis for $sign(v_0 w_0) >= 0, <= 0$

- $sign(v_0 w_0) >= 0$. let $v_0, w_0 > 0$. $⟨ v ⟩^2 >= 0 ==> v_0^2 >= ⟨ bf(v) ⟩^2$. Similarly for $w$. Then by the Euclidean inner product inequality
  $
    v_0^2 w_0^2
    >= ⟨ bf(v) ⟩^2 ⟨ bf(w) ⟩^2
    >= ⟨ bf(v), bf(w) ⟩^2
  $
  Thus $v_0 w_0 - ⟨ bf(v) , bf(w) ⟩ >= 0$, i.e., same sign as $v_0 w_0$
- $sign(v_0 w_0) <= 0$. let $v_0 > 0, w_0 < 0$. Set $w'_0 = - w_0$ and apply the conclusion from $sign(v_0 w'_0) >= 0$

in Euclidean, we have

#link(<quadratic-form-inequality-Euclidean>)[Inner product inequality] $|⟨ v,w ⟩|^2 <= abs(v) abs(w)$ ==> #link(<triangle-inequality-Euclidean>)[Triangle inequality] $|v+w| <= |v|+|w|$

in signature $p,q$ quadratic form, this generally does not hold

As mentioned earlier, the quadratic form under the basis $v,w$ corresponds to the matrix $G = mat(⟨ v,v ⟩, ⟨ v,w ⟩; ⟨ w,v ⟩, ⟨ w,w ⟩)$. Transforming to the standard quadratic form, the corresponding matrix transformation is $A^⊺ G A = mat(λ_1;,λ_2)$

    λ_1 λ_2 = det mat(λ_1;,λ_2) = (det A)^2 det G

$det G = ⟨ v ⟩^2 ⟨ w ⟩^2 - ⟨ v,w ⟩^2 = λ_1 λ_2$

The limit or continuity in Euclidean space is directly defined using open balls $𝔹(r) = { ⟨ x ⟩^2 < r^2 }$ (to simplify the discussion, only consider the origin $0$ as the center)

In Minkowski space or p,q quadratic form space, a direct imitation of the Euclidean case is
- timelike ${0 <= ⟨ x ⟩^2 < r^2 }$, spacelike ${ -r^2 < ⟨ x ⟩^2 <= 0 }$, or
- When merging classes, the class is empty ${ -r^2 < ⟨ x ⟩^2 < r^2 }$

But note that at this time
+ The limit meaning represented by $r^2 -> 0$ is different from the Euclidean case. For example, although two distinct points on the light cone are "separated," their quadratic distance is zero. For a point $a != 0$ on the light cone, although it is separated from $0$, it can be transformed via $SO(p,q)$ so that the coordinates of $a$ approach $0$ arbitrarily. Taking $ℝ^(1,1)$ as an example, let $a = (t,x) = (1,1)$. After transformation, $mat(cosh ϕ, sinh ϕ; sinh ϕ, cosh ϕ) vec(1,1) = vec(cosh ϕ + sinh ϕ, cosh ϕ + sinh ϕ) = vec(e^ϕ, e^ϕ)$, then $lim_(ϕ -> -∞) e^ϕ = 0$. $(1,1)$ under the orbit of the $SO(1,1)$ action is the ray $k (1,1), k > 0$
+ Taking $ℝ^(1,1)$ as an example, $ℍ𝕪 = { t^2 - x^2 = 1} $ should be the analogue of the sphere $𝕊 = { x^2 + y^2 = 1 }$ in $ℝ^2$. Based on graphical intuition in $ℝ^2$, some points on $ℍ𝕪$ appear far from the origin $0$, but in fact the $1,1$ distance of any point on $ℍ𝕪$ is the same; any two points on $ℍ𝕪$ can be transformed into each other via an $SO(1,1)$ transformation, just like the situation with $𝕊$. On $ℝ^(1,n)$, when the quadratic form distance $> 0$, it can be considered as the timelike geodesic distance or the proper time of an inertial particle. Timelike points on $ℝ^(1,n)$ can be transformed via $SO(1,n)$ to have zero spatial coordinates, meaning transforming from uniform motion to rest, where proper time = time. Similar conclusions likely hold for $ℝ^(p,q)$ as well.

#image("../image/hyperbolic-to-space-bijective.png", width: 50%)

$ℝ^(p,q)$'s "continuity of coordinate distance", i.e., $ℝ_+^p × ℝ_-^q$ product distance, is finer than $ℝ^(p,q)$'s "continuity of quadratic form distance", because $|x_+^2 - x_-^2| <= x_+^2 + x_-^2$

But this does not implies continuity structure of function

Denote the coordinate distance continuity structure as $C$, and the quadratic form distance continuity structure as $Q$
- When the domain continuity structure $A$ is the same, continuity of functions with codomain $C$ implies continuity of functions with codomain $Q$, $"continuous"(A -> C) ==> "continuous"(A -> Q)$
- When the codomain continuity structure $A$ is the same, continuity of functions with domain $Q$ implies continuity of functions with domain $C$, $"continuous"(Q -> A) ==> "continuous"(C -> A)$
- There is no comparison relation between $"continuous"(C -> C)$ and $"continuous"(Q -> Q)$

Possible clue for the rationality of the $p, q$ quadratic form distance: $ℝ^(p, q)$, via the $(1, 1)$ tensor $ℝ^(p,q)^⊺ ⊗ ℝ^(p,q)$ as a linear map space, inherits a tensor quadratic form. When restricted to $so(p,q)$, it becomes proportional to the Killing form quadratic form of $so(p, q)$ #link(<Killing-form-of-orthogonal-group>)[]. Signature $(p q, binom(p,2) + binom(q, 2))$, where $p q$ is the number of boosts, $binom(p,2)$ are time-like rotations, and $binom(q,2)$ are space-like rotations. Under the Killing form, boosts have positive distance, while time/space rotations both have negative distance.

$ℝ^(1,1)$'s timelike region $"time-like"(1,1) = { (t,x) in ℝ^(1,1) : t^2 - x^2 > 0 }$. It can be decomposed into the radial space part $ℝ(>= 0)$ and the directional space part $ℍ𝕪 = { (t,x) in ℝ^(1,1) : t^2 - x^2 = 1 }$
