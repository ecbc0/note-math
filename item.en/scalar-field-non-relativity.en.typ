Approximation of Relativistic Scalar Field Action to Non-Relativistic Scalar Field Action

Using a massive field, extracting the rest energy phase $exp(- m c^2 1/ℏ t #i)$, using time $x_0 = c t$ and the speed of light limit $lim_(c -> ∞)$ 

for #link(<Klein--Gordon-Lagrangian>)[], restore Planck constant $h$, speed of light $c$, time $x_0 = c t$
$
  integral_(ℝ) #d c t integral_(ℝ^3) #d x 1/2 ( 
    1/c^2 (∂_t ϕ^* ∂_t ϕ) 
    - ∂_x ϕ^* ⋅ ∂_x ϕ    
    + (m^2 c^2)/(h^2) ϕ^* ϕ
  )
$
use $ϕ = exp(- m c^2 1/ℏ t #i) ψ$

let $θ = m c^2 1/ℏ #i$

use $∂_t ϕ = θ e^(θ t) ψ + e^(θ t) ∂_t ψ$
$
  ∂_t ϕ^* ∂_t ϕ &= - (m^2 c^4)/(ℏ^2) ψ^* ψ & "use" #i^2 = -1  \
  &quad + (m c^2)/(ℏ) #i (ψ^* ∂_t ψ - ψ ∂_t ψ^*) \
  &quad + ∂_t ψ^* ∂_t ψ
$
the term $- (m^2 c^4)/(ℏ^2) ψ^* ψ$ multiplied by $1/c^2$ will cancel out the mass term $(m^2 c^2)/(ℏ^2) ϕ^* ϕ$

the term $(m c^2)/(ℏ) #i (ψ^* ∂_t ψ - ψ ∂_t ψ^*)$ multiplied by $1/c^2$ will cancel out the speed of light $c$ factor

the term $∂_t ψ^* ∂_t ψ$ multiplied by $1/c^2$ will become $O(1/c^2 (∂_t ψ^* ∂_t ψ))$, vanishing in the limit $lim_(c -> ∞)$

$#d x^0 = #d c t$ might not affect it?

Multiply the entire expression by $ℏ^2/m$ to get

  ) 
$
Can add a gauge field electrostatic potential term to the action, i.e., change $∂_t$ to $∂_t + #i/ℏ V$

Non-relativistic scalar field equation, *alias* Schrodinger-equation #tag("Schrodinger-equation")
$
  #i ℏ ∂_t ψ = - ℏ^2/(2 m) ∆ ψ + V ψ 
$
For either relativistic or non-relativistic scalar fields, it's possible to use a time plane wave mixed static solution $exp(- 1/ℏ E t #i) ψ(x)$ to obtain the eigenvalue equation
$
  - ℏ^2/(2 m) ∆ ψ + V ψ = E ψ 
$
One can also add static magnetic potential, $∂_x$ is changed to $(∂_x + #i/ℏ A) ψ$, with 

$(∂_x + #i/ℏ A)^† (∂_x + #i/h A) ψ = (∆ + #i/h div A + (2 #i)/ℏ A ⋅ ∂_x - 1/ℏ^2 |A|^2) ψ$

#tag("Schrodinger-eq-potential-example") *Example* 
- $V = k r^2$ 

  Resonator (one or more) represents the electric potential of constant charge density in $ℝ^n$ or spherical regions. $div grad r^2 = "const"$. Opposite charges correspond to elliptical type, same charges correspond to hyperbolic type.

- $V = k 1/r$

  $ℝ^3$ Hydrogen atom model (single particle, static, zero spin) represents a spherically symmetric electric potential generated by a point charge or a spherically symmetric charge sphere.
  
  Using symmetry + Gauss's theorem
  
  Or using differential equations, spherical symmetry $f(x) = f(|x|) = f(r)$ + charge concentrated at a point or spherical region, then outside $∆ f(r) = 0$ ==> $2 1/r (#d f)/(#d r) + (#d^2 f)/(#d r^2) = 0$ ==> $f(r) = k 1/r$

  *_Warning_* The Schrodinger equation has no analytical solution for atoms and molecules other than hydrogen atoms for the time being. I also don't know the existing multi-particle models and how effective their numerical calculations are.

- $V = $ box/ball potential well/barrier

- constant electric field or constant magnetic field

Regarding the non-relativistic approximation limit

- Static energy phase extraction $exp(- m c^2 1/ℏ t #i)$ is not a gauge transformation.
- Can $ℂ$ be generalized to $ℍ,𝕆$? Replace $#i$ with any $Im(𝕂)$ unit element. $ℝ$ doesn't work? Or $ℝ$ is used for hyperbolic mass KG rather than elliptical mass KG, in one-dimensional $ℝ$ the equation $x^2 = -1$ cannot be solved)
- This method of non-relativistic approximation limit is coordinate-dependent. On curved manifolds, since multiple coordinates may be needed to cover the entire manifold, the definition problem of the non-relativistic approximation limit will be more difficult.

Symmetry and Conserved Current

let 
$
  L(ψ,∂_t ψ,∂_x ψ) = 1/2 (
    ℏ #i (ψ^* ∂_t ψ - ψ ∂_t ψ^*) 
    - ℏ^2/m ∂_x ψ^* ⋅ ∂_x ψ
  )
$
Similar to the case of relativistic scalar field, energy-momentum tensor #tag("energy-momentum-tensor-Schrodinger")
$
  T = T^(μ)_(ν) = cases(
    (∂ L)/(∂ (∂_(ν) ψ)) ⋅ ∂_(ν) ψ - L & " if " μ = ν ,
    (∂ L)/(∂ (∂_(μ) ψ)) ⋅ ∂_(ν) ψ & " if " μ != ν
  )
$
Time
$
  (∂ L)/(∂ (∂_t ϕ)) ⋅ ∂_(ν) ψ 
  &= 1/2 ℏ #i (ψ^* ∂_(ν) ψ - ψ ∂_(ν) ψ^*) \
  &= ℏ #i Im(ψ^* ∂_(ν) ψ) \
$
Space
$
  (∂ L)/(∂ (∂_x ϕ)) ⋅ ∂_(ν) ψ 
  &= - (ℏ^2)/(2m) (∂_(ν) ψ^*  ∂_x ψ + ∂_x ψ^* ∂_(ν) ψ) \
  &= - (ℏ^2)/(2m) Re(∂_x ψ^* ∂_(ν) ψ)
$
Energy
$
  E = integral_(ℝ^3) #d x (T^0_0) 
  = integral_(ℝ^3) #d x ((ℏ^2)/(2m) |∂_x ψ|^2)
$
Due to the zero divergence of the energy-momentum tensor, energy is conserved with respect to time $t$, $∂_t E = 0$

For non-relativistic scalar fields, the energy of the Schrodinger field is real, positive and time invariant

Rotational angular momentum is #tag("angular-momentum-Schrodinger")
$
  M^k_(i j) = [x_i,T^k_j]
$
Gauge current of the Schrodinger field

Phase change $e^(θ(x)) ϕ(x)$ and its δ change $θ ϕ$ belong to variations with fixed boundaries near the solution, so

The spatial part of the current is similar to the relativistic case, $(ℏ^2)/(2m) (ψ^* ∂_x ψ - ψ ∂_x ψ^*) = (ℏ^2)/(m) Im(ψ^* ∂_x ψ)$

The time part of the current ($θ(x) ∈ Im(ℂ)$)
$
  ℏ Im ( (- θ ψ^*) ∂_t ψ + ψ^* ∂_t (θ ψ) )= ℏ Im (ψ^* ψ ∂_t θ)
$ 
The result will be the quantity $#i ℏ ψ^* ψ$

The entire current, after dividing by $#i ℏ$, is $(ψ^* ψ, - (#i ℏ)/(2m) (ψ^* ∂_x ψ - ψ ∂_x ψ^*)$ #tag("current-gauge-Schrodinger")

The time component of the Schrodinger field gauge current is real, and the spatial component is purely imaginary

Assume $j$ is an integrable quantity in $ℝ^3$

time-invariant $∂_0 integral_(ℝ^3) #d x ( j^0 ) = 0$ by $∂^† T = 0$ #tag("conserved-spatial-integral-charge-Schrodinger")
$ 
  integral_(ℝ^3) #d x ( j^0 ) 
  &= integral_(ℝ^3) #d x (ψ^* ψ) \
  &= integral_(ℝ^3) #d x |ψ|^2 
$
The time component of the Schrodinger field current is positive and its spatial integral is time invariant

Should this quantity be "particle number density" or "probability density" or "electric charge density"?

*_Warning_* No one can currently solve atoms other than hydrogen atoms using the Schrodinger equation. What form of many-particle interaction model should be used is also not an obvious matter. No repeatable evidence or downstream applications

#tag("motivation-of-quantization")
#indent[
  Most treatments of quantization assume

  - Linear unitary evolution of $ℂ$ field

  - Possibly non-free fields, so plane waves cannot be used

  If the non-relativistic approximation limit of the KG field is considered, these assumptions will be automatically obtained.

  Then, the time component of the static gauge field acts as the electric potential. Both the harmonic oscillator potential $k r^2$ and the hydrogen atom potential $k 1/r$ originate from simple charge densities.

  Thus, the motivation problem becomes:

  - Why use $ℂ$ KG field?

  - Why and how does it correspond to point particles?

  - Why does the potential of a gauge field become the potential of a particle when the field is quantized into particles?

  Classical correspondence refers to the expected value version of the point particle Lagrange-equation (#link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrenfest_theorem")[wiki:Ehrenfest_theorem]). How to make the expected value version of the point particle Lagrange-equation correspond to the Lagrange-equation of the field?

  Schrodinger eq is the non-relativistic limit of $ℂ$ KG eq, and Newton's equation is the non-relativistic limit of relativistic point particles. So, can it be proven that KG eq also has a point particle limit? At this point, should the definition of "expectation" use the charge density of $#U (1)$'s KG $- ϕ^* ∂_t ϕ + ϕ ∂_t ϕ^*$ (even if it's not a positive definite density)? 

  Other signs that the Schrodinger wave function corresponds to point particles:

  - A plane wave $e^(- #i E t) e^(#i p x)$ is a solution to the Schrodinger eq <==> $E = p^2/(2m) + V(x)$. This equality cannot hold for a non-constant $V(x)$, but it holds in the embedded point particle solution $x(t)$, because the energy of the point particle $E = 1/2 m vel(x)^2 (t) + V(x(t))$ is constant over time.

  - Path integrals use the path statistics weighted by the point particle Lagrangian to calculate the propagator of the Schrodinger eq.

For harmonic oscillator $k r^2$ and hydrogen atom $k 1/r$, if we assume the phase of the wave function oscillates as $e^(- #i E t)$ and the amplitude is static $ψ(x)$, then $e^(- #i E t) ψ(x)$ satisfies the Schrodinger or Dirac eq <==> $ψ(x)$ satisfies the eigenvalue equation $#H ψ = E ψ$ for a Hermitian operator, and $E$ is discrete, for bound states of elliptic harmonic oscillators and hydrogen atoms.
