  Or use continuous piecewise affine linear or simplicial function e.g. for simplex with vertices $x_0 ,…, x_n$, $f(sum t_i x_i) = t_i f(x_i)$. The integral is defined as the average of the values according to the vertices i.e. the result of the affine center mapping $f((x_0 + ⋯ + x_n)/(n+1)) Vol("simp"(x_1 ,…, x_n))$

According to the decomposition of simplex intersection and subtraction, the finite addition and subtraction of piecewise constant functions is still a piecewise constant function

Define the integral distance $‖f - g‖_1 = integral |f - g|$. Or use $2$ norm $‖f - g‖_2 = (integral |f - g|^2)^(1/2)$

  $ϕ ∈ L^1 $ := $forall ε > 0$ there exist piecewise constant functions $f,g$ such that $|ϕ - f| <= |g|$ and $‖g‖ = integral |g| < ε$

*Example* But it should be noted that, although the integral distance Cauchy net is always integrally convergent, there exists an integral distance Cauchy net that does not converge pointwise to the limit function
#indent[
  The bisection walk sequence is Cauchy in integral distance, and the measure tends to $0$
  $ 
    f_1 &= 𝟙_([0,1/2]) \
    f_2 &= 𝟙_([1/2,1]) \
    f_3 &= 𝟙_([0,1/4]) \
    &⋯ \
    f_(2 + ⋯ + 2^k + p) &= 𝟙_([(p-1)/2^k, p/2^k])

  It does not follow the definition of pointwise convergence

  $ forall x in [0,1] , forall N in ℕ , exists i,j > N \ f_i (x) = 0, f_j (x) = 1 $

  Although conceptually it converges to the empty set

  But for all $L^1,L^2$ integral distances, there exists a subnet in the Cauchy net that converges almost everywhere pointwise to the target integrable function. This comes from the fact that there exists a set $A$ with arbitrarily small measure such that it converges absolutely and uniformly on $A^∁$

The measurable set defined by $𝟙_A in $L^1,L^2$$ is a Lebesgue measurable set, which may be disconnected

What we define is absolutely integrable. Other integral operations, such as $integral_(-∞)^(∞)  e^(- #i x^2) $, are special limit operations based on absolute integrability, and are related to the environment of the problem

The linear change of coordinates $A in GL$ gives the integral change of variable formula formula $det A$

#tag("integral-on-form") For the integral over an $n$-region, integrating a function over a volume is equivalent to integrating an $n$-form. If considered as an integral of an $n$-form, then the integral is $GL$ invariant.

  The change of variable formula formula for diffeomorphisms of integrals is $integral_(ℝ^n) f = integral_(ℝ^n) (f ∘ ϕ) |det #d ϕ|$ or $integral_(ℝ^n) #d y space f(y) = integral_(ℝ^n) #d x space (f ∘ ϕ)(x) |det #d ϕ (x)|$
  
  The differential of the coordinate transformation map $#d f$ at each simplex center as an affine map acting on the domain simplex is used to obtain the range space simplex for approximation, then use (high order) #link(<mean-value-theorem-analytic>)[], then take partition limit (@ref-12, p.92--99)
  
  It is necessary to first perform compact uniform control on the bounded region for the approximation of the differential mean value theorem
  
  Then the unbounded region is a countable approximation from the bounded region, using the $sum_(i = 1 .. ∞) ε_i < ε$ technique

  If it is considered as integrating an $n$ form, (cf. #link(<integral-on-form>)[]) then the integral change of variable formula is equivalent to $n$ form integration is diffeomorphism invariant

#tag("integral-on-manfold") *Question*
#indent[
  According to the change of variable formula, the integral of $n$ form in the coordinates on the manifold is invariant (cf. #link(<integral-on-form>)[])

  But what if we want to integrate the $n$ form defined on the entire #link(<orientable>)[] manifold?

  One way is, similar to the proof of #link(<integral-change-of-variable-formula>)[], in coordinate, linear approximation + compact uniformly control + partition limit, then use countable cover to approximate entire manifold

  In order to define the integral, some kind of countability assumption is needed. The simplest assumption is that the manifold can be covered by countable coordinate cards. Let's use this assumption

  Now the problem is that the integral at the intersection of the coordinate cards is repeated and needs to be removed

  I will not use measurable sets being closed under intersection and set-minus, nor use curved simplex (box) type region partition *alias* triangulation, which is even more difficult to proof

  Instead, I will use the linear approximation version of triangulation. Under linear approximation, simplex is closed under intersection and set-minus (polyhedra decompose to to simplex) 

  e.g. the differential $#d f$ of the transition map at each simplex (box) center as an #link(<affine-map-point-ver>)[] (linear-map) to transform the simplex (box) to the simplex of the coordinate region $A$. Then the intersection and reduction of the simplex (box) can be decomposed into the simplex (box) again.

  Taking the limit of this approximation, require $L^1,L^2$ style absolute convergence, gives the integral on the manifold

  Prove that the result does not depend on the choice of coordinate system and linear approximation method

The measures and integrals defined by rectangles and simplexes (without fixed coordinate axes) are equivalent, because rectangles and simplexes can be countably approximated to each other

$ integral_X #d x integral_X' #d x' f(x,x') = integral_(X × X') #d (x,x') f(x,x') = integral_X' #d x' integral_X #d x f(x,x') $

Because the piecewise constant value of the rectangular region is product decomposable, and then use the absolutely convergent upper bound to control it

Fubini theorem 2 ... (@ref-5)

Fubini's theorem can be used to prove that the volume calculation below the graph of a function is the integral of the height function with respect to the volume of the base

  The integral of a form over a $k$-simplex is also invariant, and there's no need to define volume for lower-dimensional simplices.

  constant-type form

  simplicial map type $k$ form := Let $x_0 ,…, x_k$ be the vertices of the simplex, then $ω(sum t_i x_i) = sum t_i ω(x_i)$

  Similar to the $n$-order case, the integral of a simplicial map form on a $k$-chain is defined as $integral_(σ) ω = sum ω("center of" σ_i) Vol(σ_i)$

  Even if two $k$-simplices are adjacent, their orientations might be discontinuous. This is different from the $n$-order case, where the codimension is zero, so all $n$-simplices have the same orientation.
  
  Two adjacent $k$-simplices share common vertices, and the form acting on these points might have different values. The integral of a simplicial type form is also equivalent to taking the average of the directions at the vertices.

  A good approximation would require the $k$-directions to have good regularity, but without additional structure, it seems difficult to define such a concept (even for a Grassmann manifold?).

  submanifold structure can simply eliminate this $k$-direction discontinuity.

  $n$ form in $M$ is equivalent to scalar function, but how to control $n-1$ form by integral? try $sup(S : "orientable" n-1 "submanifold")(integral_(S) |ω - ω'|)$?

  if unnecessary, do not introduce metric to define $integral_M (⟨ ω ⟩^2)^(1/2)$ or $(integral_M ⟨ ω ⟩^2)^(1/2)$ now
